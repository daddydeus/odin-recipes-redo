            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons chilli flakes <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic <em>crushed or grated</em></li>
                <li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
                <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together all of the Peri Peri marinade ingredients (i.e. all the ingredients apart from the actual chicken!) in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in the bowl, turning to coat each piece of chicken with marinade. (You can do this in a ziplock bag if you don’t like getting your hands messy!)</li>
                <li>Cover and marinate the chicken for 2 hours in the fridge or up to 24 hours if you have the time. Alternatively, just continue with the recipe.</li>
                <li>Heat your griddle/frying pan for 2 minutes over a high heat (see notes for alternative cooking methods).</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in the pan and cook for 7-9 minutes on each side (depending on thickness – you can check if your chicken is done by cutting into the thickest one – if it’s not raw and pink, you are good to go!).</li>
                <li>Serve with all your favourite Nando’s style sides!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To oven bake, preheat your oven to 200C. Cook the chicken breasts for 25-30 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
                <li>To grill (US - broil), preheat your grill to high. Cook the chicken breasts for 7-9 minutes on each side, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
                <li>To BBQ (US - grill), when your BBQ is ready to cook on, cook the chicken breasts for 7-9 minutes on each side, or until cooked all the way through.</li>
