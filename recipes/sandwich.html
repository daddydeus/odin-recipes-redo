            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large nonstick pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li><p>Add the sausages and cook until deeply browned, turning them occasionally, for about 10 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Once their skins have crisped, remove them from the pan and slice them open.</p>
                    <p>Place them back in the pan cut-side down to continue to cook until fully cooked, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Remove from the pan and cut in half.</li>
                <li>Toast your English muffins. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk the eggs in a blender to get them extra fluffy.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a medium nonstick pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter.</p>
                    <p>Pour in the eggs and cook, stirring constantly with a spatula.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Once the eggs are starting to set but are not yet fully cooked, add a sprinkle of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Divide the egg into two portions in the pan.</p>
                    <p>Place the slices of cheese on top off each portion and cover with a lid, for the egg to fully cook and the cheese to melt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Butter the English muffins and place the eggs and cheese on the bottom section.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle with chives.</p>
                    <p>On the other side, place the sausages and top with Marinated Red Onions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Close sandwich and enjoy!
